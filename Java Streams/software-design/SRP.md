#SRP


**Classes should have a single responsibility and thus only a single reason to change.**
**A class should have single purpose and all its methods should be related to that purpose!!**


The SRP is a widely quoted justification for refactoring. This is often done without full understanding of the point of the SRP and its context, leading to fragmentation of code bases with a range of negative consequences. Instead of being a one-way street to minimally sized classes, the SRP is actually proposing a balance point between aggregation and division.

The Single Responsibility Principle is closely related to the concepts of coupling and cohesion. 


The primary benefit the Single-Responsibility Principle gives you is **high-cohesion, low-coupling** code.

Cohesion refers to the degree with which elements of code belong together. This means that the level of cohesion between elements is higher if they are related, and lower if they are not.

Coupling is the manner of independence between modules of a programming system. This means that high coupling means that modules are more dependent upon one another, and low coupling means they are less dependent.
